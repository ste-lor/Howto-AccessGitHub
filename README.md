**For Windows:**<br />
First, the desired Python version has to be installed. To do that, go to [PythonVersionsWindows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the version of your choice.
<br />

It is convenient to store all local versions in a single folder. One possibility is shown below. There are currently two different Python versions stored in the file "C:\Python".
````
C:\Python\Python3.8.8
C:\Python\Python3.9.10

<br />
<br />
Once the desired Python version is installed, continue with the following steps.
Install via pip,

````
pip install virtualenv
````
Next, navigate to the desired folder where the virtual environment should be installed,
````
cd C:\Users\my_project
````
Within the desired folder install your new environment for the specific Python version,
````
virtualenv my_venv --python=python3.8.8
